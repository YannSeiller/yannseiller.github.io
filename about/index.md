<p> Hi ! I'm <strong>Yann Seiller</strong> and this is my personal blog. </p> 


<p> I'm french and I was born in a small city, north-east France. One thing that can caracterized me is the fact that most things, in this world, interest me. Of course, technologies and humain relation with them is a crucial subject for me, but not it's not the only one. I'am a proponent of what I call a <em>"well-balanced life"</em>. </p>

<p> Let me explain: I consider that it's really significant to be multi-skilled, and to be able to be interested in many domains. It's a plus for a simple reason: in our profesional and private life, we will be more and more exposed to amazing cases, have seen many different things bring us an open-mindedness, which help us to deal with every challenge. </p>

## Things that I like to do or I'm interested in
* Of course, technologies and challenges of the new century
* Machine learning, deep-learning and things related to AI
* Big Data and our private life, how to concil them ? Do we have the choice ? 
* Nature, environnement, energy and all the issues with globalwarming
* Space conquest and astronomy
* Sports ! Visit the related area !
* Readings and writting exercises, It's a deep part of me
* Photography, arts and culture

## A well-balanced life

Just few things are sufficient for me: my laptop, a landscape, a book and a mountain that just wait to be climbed !
