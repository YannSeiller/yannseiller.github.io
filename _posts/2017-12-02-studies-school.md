## Entrance

I arrived at <a href="http://www.ec-lyon.fr/"> École Centrale de Lyon </a> after passing the entrance exams. I chose this school for many reasons, and amongst them the fact that École Centrale de Lyon is a way of excellence in many domains.

## Courses

I took many different courses to discover what I like to do. For example, I follow courses in:

* Maths
* Physics


## Organizations
