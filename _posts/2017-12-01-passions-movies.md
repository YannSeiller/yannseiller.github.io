# Movies and cinemas

## My outlook

It's quite amasing to discover things through the screen with a movie. The movie director gives a sense and a meaning of his realisation and capture it is a thing that I like to do. Example: go watching Tarantino's movies. Movies can be interesting by many aspects, they can relax us ( The Truman show), make us cry or laugh (The fault in our stars), surprise us (Usual Suspects, Memento), frighten us (Seven) or informed us (Before the flood). And sometimes, movies do everything at once (Miyazakis' Castle in the sky, Gran Torino, Mommy and others...)
